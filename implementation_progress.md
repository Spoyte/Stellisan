  - [ ] Exercise submission
  - [ ] Correction system
  - [ ] Token rewards
  - [x] Reputation tracking UI

**Completed Work**:
- **User Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard with stats, activity feed, and achievements
- **Profile Management**: User profile page with tabs for overview, submissions, corrections, and settings
- **Reusable Components**: StatsCard, ActivityFeed, UserProfileCard for consistent UI
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication wrapper for secure pages
- **Header Component**: Shared navigation with user info and wallet balance
- **Time Utilities**: Relative time formatting for better UX
- **Login Modal**: Seamless authentication flow from landing page

## Current Focus
User dashboard and profile management completed! Next: Exercise submission and correction flows to complete the core learning loop.

## Notes
- Using Stellar testnet for initial development
- Following the technical plan specifications
- Implementing MVP features first, then expanding

## Issues & Blockers
None currently.

## Next Steps
1. Set up project directory structure
2. Initialize smart contract workspace
3. Create basic frontend structure
