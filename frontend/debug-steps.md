# Debugging Steps for Stellisan Frontend

## Quick Fixes to Try:

### 1. Check if basic pages work:
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/working
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/test
- If these work, Next.js is fine!

### 2. Check the main page:
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/
- Should now work with simplified version (no complex imports)

### 3. If still having issues, check the terminal:
Look for specific error messages in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.

### 4. Common issues and fixes:

**A. Port already in use:**
```bash
# Kill any process on port 3000
sudo lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

**B. Clear Next.js cache:**
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

**C. Reinstall dependencies:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. If complex pages don't work:
The issue is likely with these imports:
- `lucide-react` icons
- `@stellar/stellar-sdk` 
- `passkey-kit`
- `zustand` store

**Temporary fix:** Use the simplified versions we created.

### 6. Working pages to test:
- `/working` - Basic functionality test
- `/test` - Simple test page  
- `/` - Simplified homepage (should work)

### 7. Pages that might have issues:
- `/dashboard` - Complex components
- `/profile` - TypeScript errors fixed, but may have import issues

## Next Steps:
Once basic pages work, we can gradually add back the complex functionality with proper error handling.
